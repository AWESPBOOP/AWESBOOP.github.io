  <h1> Mass and Weight whats the difference? </h1>
<h3> Mass </h3>
<p> Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Mass can be measured with a triple beam balance scale.</p>
<h3> Weight </h3> 
<p> Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object. Weight can be measured with a spring scale. </p>
<h2> An example </h2> 
<p> If your on the moon your mass stays the same however you would get lighter. This is because mass always stays the same, but gravity can change.</p>
<h3> Units of measurement </h3> 
<ul>
<li> Weight: newtons </li>
<li> Mass: Grams </li>
<li> Volume: Ml </li>
<li> Density: Grams per cm or mil </li>
</ul>
